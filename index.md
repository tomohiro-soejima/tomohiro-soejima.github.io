## About me

My name is Tomohiro Soejima, and I am a physics graduate student at University of California, Berkeley. I am currently working with Prof. Mike Zaletel on tensor network techniques for strongly correlated systems. In my spare time, I can be found singing, playing contract bridge, reading about American history, or playing Shogi (将棋).

##  Research

My main area of research is condensed matter physics, and specifically tensor network related numerical methods. I also worked on more materials science related work, such as [this]() 

## Publications

Full publication list (since graduate school) can be found on [my arXiv author profile](). Here is a partial list of publications.

1. Efficient simulation of moire materials
1. Isometric tensor network liquids
1. 2D MOF related project

## Talks

1. Isometric tensor network representation of string-net liquids. Watanabe group, group seminar. University of Tokyo.
1.

## Outreach and Service

I was a member and co-President of MIT Clubchem during my undergraduate years and performed "Chemistry magic shows" to local primary school students on a regular basis.

At Berkeley, I am part of [BASIS](). We go to local primary schools to hold one-hour hands-on classes on some scientific concept.

Inside Berkeley, I have mentored three undergraduate students via math and physics directed reading programs (DRP), as well as mentoring undergradute researc project at the Zaletel group.

I also served on the soft condensed matter search committee (Fall 2020) as a student liason.
