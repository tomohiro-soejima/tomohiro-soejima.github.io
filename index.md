### About me
My name is Tomohiro Soejima, and I am a physics graduate student at University of California, Berkeley.

I am currently working with Prof. Mike Zaletel on tensor network techniques for strongly correlated systems. In my spare time, I can be found singing, playing contract bridge, reading about American history, or playing Shogi (将棋).

##  Research

My main area of research is condensed matter physics, and specifically tensor network related numerical methods and twisted bilayer graphene. I also have a passion on Metal-Organic Frameworks, and have worked on them both experimanntally and theoretically.

## Publications

Full publication list (since graduate school) can be found on [my arXiv author profile](https://arxiv.org/a/soejima_t_1.html). Here is a partial list of publications.

@@pubs **Efficient simulation of moiré materials using the density matrix renormalization group**

## Outreach and Service

I was a member and co-President of [MIT Clubchem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCmNu9vNcyI&feature=youtu.be) during my undergraduate years and performed "Chemistry magic shows" to local primary school students on a regular basis.

At Berkeley, I am part of [BASIS](https://www.crscience.org/outreach/basis/). We go to local primary schools to hold one-hour hands-on classes on some scientific concept.

Inside Berkeley, I have mentored three undergraduate students via math and physics directed reading programs ([DRP](https://berkeleyphysicsdrp.wixsite.com/physicsberkeleydrp#:~:text=The%20Berkeley%20Physics%20Directed%20Reading,graduate%20student%20in%20the%20department.)), as well as mentoring undergradute research project at the Zaletel group.

I am also serving on the soft condensed matter faculty search committee (Fall 2020) as a student liason.
