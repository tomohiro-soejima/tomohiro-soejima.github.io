### About me
My name is Tomohiro Soejima, and I am a postdoctoral scholar at Harvard University.
Prior to this, I was a physics graduate student at University of California, Berkeley, where I worked with Prof. Mike Zaletel on tensor networks methods and twisted bilayer graphene.

In my spare time, I can be found singing, watching soccer, reading about American history, or playing Shogi (将棋).

##  Research

My main area of research is condensed matter physics, and specifically tensor network related numerical methods and twisted bilayer graphene.
I am also interested in understanding entanglement properties of topological ordered states.
I have also worked on variational quantum algorithms for condensed matter systems as an intern at IBM quantum.

## Outreach and Service

I was a member and co-President of [MIT Clubchem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCmNu9vNcyI&feature=youtu.be) during my undergraduate years and performed "Chemistry magic shows" to local primary school students on a regular basis.

At Berkeley, I am part of [BASIS](https://www.crscience.org/outreach/basis/). We go to local primary schools to hold one-hour hands-on classes on some scientific concept.

Inside Berkeley, I have mentored three undergraduate students via math and physics directed reading programs ([DRP](https://berkeleyphysicsdrp.wixsite.com/physicsberkeleydrp#:~:text=The%20Berkeley%20Physics%20Directed%20Reading,graduate%20student%20in%20the%20department.)), as well as mentoring undergradute research project at the Zaletel group.

I am also serving on the soft condensed matter faculty search committee (Fall 2020) as a student liason.
